# USD_Pop_Properties
Solaris HDA that lets you tweak point properties inside of LOPs

Note : 
Pscale, Cd, v, accel and Alpha should exist on your points before importing into LOPs

Alpha requires you to plug a mtlx geometry property value set to "displayOpacity" into the opacity channel of the mtlx surface shader
